The purpose of this project was meant to be a funny birthday present. 
I intentionally built it to look like an old school desktop game with Mario game as the background. 
This game has two levels and the main task of this game is to match the pictures. 
Every time the game is played, the pictures will distribute randomly and 
before the player matches all the pictures, if he or she match one pair wrong, 
all the picture will turn back to hidden/unrevealed. 
Otherwise, if the pictures are matched, the pictures will stay reveled.
